# Issues when starting events

Attention to all our valued users, we've noticed some of you encountering issues when trying to start an event. 

We would like to stress the importance of typing the command **!event** only once. Please refrain from entering this command multiple times. Entering **!event** repeatedly could potentially lead to a silent crash of the server, necessitating you to manually reboot your respective server. Instructions for restarting your server can be found [here](how-to-restart-server).

We understand this might cause some inconvenience and are putting measures in place to prevent such occurrences. In the meantime, we appreciate your understanding and cooperation in only entering the command once.

As always, we're here to support you in any way we can, ensuring your Stardew Valley experience is smooth and enjoyable. If you have any further issues or require any assistance, don't hesitate to reach us through our Discord or email us at contact@junimohost.com.

Thank you for choosing Junimohost for your Stardew Valley multiplayer experience. Happy Farming!
